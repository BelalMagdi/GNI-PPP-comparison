# GNI-PPP-comparison
This project compares the GNI and PPP of the Egyptian economy across the past 30 years.

I take the two datatsets, GNI.csv and PPP.csv, which are both provided by the World Bank. I clean the data to get only Egypt and the relevant data I need for the project. 
I then proceed to visualize the relationship between those two plots and analyze it.
